      - Tuples are used to store data which should not be modified.
      -It occupies less memory compared to list.
      
Set: If you need to store unordered group of elements of same or different datatypes.
     -A set does not accept duplicate elemets.
     -Sets are mutable so we can modify its element.
     -Sets are unordered so we can not access its element using index.
     
Dictionary: If you need to store elements in the form of Key-value pair of same or different datatype.
