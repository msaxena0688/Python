1)Mutability :
    -List is Mutable
    -Tuple is Immutable
    
2)Memory Consumption:
    -Tuple object takes less memory that list object for same data.
    -List is slow in execution than tuple
    -List is less efficient in memory utilization than tuple
    
3)Comprehension Concept-
    -Comprehension concept is applicable only for list and not for tuple

4)Packing and Unpacking :
    -List supports packing but not support unpacking
    -Tuple supports both packing and unpacking
    a,b,c,d=(1,12,'hello',23) --->Not possible in list
    
-If you are sure there is no modification needed ,you can use tuple as it is more efficient.
-If you know there can be modification later ,use List
